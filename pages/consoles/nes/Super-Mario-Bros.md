# Cartridge
The original **Super Mario Bros.** cartridge for the NES used the **NES-NROM-256** board (**HVC-NROM-256K** in Japan). 

This board was a standard ROM-only (NROM) configuration, featuring 32 KB of PRG (Program) ROM and 8 KB of CHR (Character) ROM. The "256" in the name refers to the size of the PRG ROM in kilobits (32 KB = 256 kilobits).

This board was commonly used in early NES games and did not include any special memory mapping hardware, relying solely on the CPU's built-in capabilities to access the ROM data.

The number at the end of the board designation, such as **NES-NROM-256-01**, typically refers to a specific version or revision of that particular board type. 

In this case it was used for revisions based on region as can be seen in the table below:

Region | Board
---|---
USA | NES-NROM-256-01
Europe | NES-NROM-256-02
UK | NES-NROM-256-03
Germany/Sweden | NES-NROM-256-06
Spain | NES-NROM-256-08
Japan | HVC-NROM-256K-02

But not that the number at the end is not a region identifier, its more of a revision identifier. 

Note that the table above was provided thanks to the data available at [NesCartDB](https://nescartdb.com/search/basic?keywords=super+Mario+bros.&kwtype=game), it is possible that revision 04, 05 and 07 exist but noone has yet added them to the **NesCartDB**.

Revisions might involve minor changes or improvements to the board's design, manufacturing process, or component layout, but they don't typically affect the overall functionality or behavior of the game.
