# Introduction 

## What versions of the SDK have been leaked?
* Version 1.5.0 (psp_full_sdk_JSR) from 2005
* Version 6.6.0 (psp_sdk_660) from 2011

This page will document the latest release version 6.6.0 as it is the most complete. The 1.5.0 JSR version only contains the files that get installed to **C:\usr\local\psp\devkit** on windows. 

Wheras the more complete version also contains the ProDG installers and additional documentation.

## What was included in the SDK?
Later versions of the SDK included the ProDG development kit provided by SN Systems, which provided a way to compile PSP games using Visual Studio 2005/2008/.NET as an alternative to the Cygwin (unix like) development environment provided in the rest of the SDK.

For information on the ProDG SDK we have a seperate post:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="//" description="For more information check out this post." %}
