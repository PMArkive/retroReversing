# Introduction 

## What versions of the SDK have been leaked?
* **Version 1.5.0** (psp_full_sdk_JSR) from 2005
* **Version 6.6.0** (psp_sdk_660) from 2011

This page will document the latest release version 6.6.0 as it is the most complete. The 1.5.0 JSR version only contains the files that get installed to **C:\usr\local\psp\devkit** on windows. 

Wheras the more complete version also contains the ProDG installers and additional documentation.

## What was included in the SDK?
Later versions of the SDK included the ProDG development kit provided by SN Systems, which provided a way to compile PSP games using Visual Studio 2005/2008/.NET as an alternative to the Cygwin (unix like) development environment provided in the rest of the SDK.

For information on the ProDG SDK we have a seperate post:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/sn-systems-pro-dg-psp-sdk/" description="For more information check out this post." %}

# PSP PGF Fonts  (pgf_archives_1.0.0)
<section class="postSection">
  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
 This folder contains infromation on the officially supported fonts for PSP.

The PGF font format is a proprietary font format developed by Sony specifically for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). It is used to render text in PSP applications and games efficiently, taking into account the constraints of the PSP hardware. PGF stands for PlayStation Game Font, and it is part of the PSP's system libraries.

 They are mainly:
 * FTT-Matisse Pro Latin - serif font
 * FTT-NewRodin Pro Latin - san serif font
 * AsiaKNHH-SONY-uni - Korean font

In various different combinations such as bold italic etc

This folder also contains the following sub-directories for each size of the font, containing all the .pgf files for each variant (korean, japanese etc):
* **org** - the original version of the font
* **6pt** -  6 point version of the font
* **8pt** -  8 point version of the font
* **10pt** - 10 point version of the font
* **14pt** - 14 point version of the font
* **18pt** - 18 point version of the font
* **22pt** - 22 point version of the font


Developers were free to use all the PGF files that are contained in this archive file via "libfont," which is included in PSP Runtime Library 2.0.0 or later.

File Name | Extension | Description
---|---|---
Install_e | .bat | Windows Batch file for moving the bin.windows exe files into the bin directory 
Readme-English | .txt | Brief description of the Contents of the devkit directory

Readme-Testing_tool_Kernel_Update_Binary-English | .txt | List of files in the flash folder and a changelog

## Install instructions
When first recieving the devkit the developers had to run a few commands to install the SDK.

```
    Cygwin > cd /usr/local/psp
    Cygwin > unzip psp-utils-x.x.x-windows.zip
    Cygwin > cd ./devkit
    Cygwin > ./Install_e.bat
```

This will move the Linux commands in **/usr/local/psp/devkit/bin** to **/usr/local/psp/devkit/bin.linux** and will install commands for Windows XP.
After installation, /usr/local/psp/devkit/bin.linux and /usr/local/psp/devkit/bin.windows may be deleted.

**SMT** are a group of web-based tools that support the development of applications with respect to the various PlayStation®Network communication services. 

In the course of testing the behavior of applications in the communication services (such as the NP score ranking service, NP matching 2 service, and patch distribution service), SMT functions can be used to modify PlayStation®Network server settings and to obtain registered data.

The **SMT Portal** is a portal site for connecting to the various SMT tools and for managing all the user and organization privileges for the tools. 

The "administrator", the user who registered the NP Communication IDs and title IDs (product codes) for an organization, can set the access privileges for the organization and the organization's users using the SMT Portal.

The PSP kernel loader can handle two types of object files. One is a relocatable object file format unique to the PSPTM kernel called a PRX file, and the other is a normal ELF executable object file.
Every module that is loaded in memory is identified by a unique 32-bit ID called a module ID.

A PRX-format module can be used as a resident library. A resident library provides some of its functions to another module.

**BSOD** is a module which, when erroneous processing occurs in a program on the DTP-H1500, if possible halts the program in that state and allows the conditions in which the error occurred to be observed. 

It enables the values of registers and of the program counter, the state of threads, and the state of the synchronization primitives such as semaphores and event flags, to be observed as they were at the time when the crash occurred.
