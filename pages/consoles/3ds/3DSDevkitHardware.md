# Official Development kits
Nintendo’s official 3DS development hardware was created in collaboration with **Intelligent Systems (IS)** and **Kyoto Microcomputer Co.**.

## CTR Target Board - Prototype Hardware

The earliest known 3DS dev kit was a bare-bones prototype board used during development before the final 3DS hardware was ready, which has a resemblence to the prototype board that was leaked for the DS.

An FCC filing in 2010 revealed a **Nintendo CTR Target Board** test kit consisting of two attached screens (a widescreen 3D top panel and a 4:3 bottom panel) mounted on a circuit board [^1].

This board included a Nintendo DS cartridge slot and SD card slot, indicating backward compatibility and storage, and was used to validate new components like the Wi-Fi module prior to the 3DS’s release.

This early dev hardware made it clear that only the top screen would have **Sharp’s auto-stereoscopic 3D capability**, while the bottom screen was a standard LCD [^1].

The CTR Target Board allowed first-party developers to begin building 3DS software on prototype hardware months before the retail units were finalized, but as far as we know it was never used outside of Nintendo.
