# File Formats used to distribute PS1 Discs
A Playstation One CD can either be directly put into your PC via the CD-ROM drive or mounting a .BIN/.ISO file. All of these are just ways to be able to see the contents of a PS1 Disc similar to a folder of files.

Extension | Description
--- | ---
.BIN | A BIN file needs a .CUE file in order to be useful, it is the raw binary contents of a PS1 disc
.CUE | A CUE sheet describes a .BIN file and can be `mounted` on a pc to reveal the file system of the disc
.ISO | A ISO file can be `mounted` on a pc to reveal the file system of the disc
.CHD | **Compressed Hunks of Data** (CHD) format intiially created by MAME can be used in most PS1 emulators
.PBP | **Playstation Boot Package** - PS1 games that run on the PSP (and also PS Classic)

# 3D Model Formats (RSD Formats)
These formats tend to be only available in source code and relate to 3D models. 

Most of these are human readable ASCII files apart from TMD which is optimised for the game itself and DXF which is generated by the original 3D modeeling application (e.g 3D Studio).

You can convert DXF to RSD formats using the tool **DXF2RSD** provided in the PSQ SDK.

Format | Description
---|---
DXF | **Drawing Exchange Format**, Standard 3D model format used in a variety of 3D software such as AutoCAD and 3D Studio
RSD | Format used in the 3D Graphics Tools while artists are editing
PLY | Polygon vertices information (coordinates)
MAT | Material (Texture) Information
GRP | Group of Polygon information
MSH | Mesh, information on how polygons are linked together
PVT | Pivot file used for rotation information
COD | Coordinate for Vertex data
MOT | Animation information
OGP | Vertex grouping information
TMD | Format used by the game itself, MD is Modelling Data (What does the T stand for?)
