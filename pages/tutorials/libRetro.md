# Understanding libRetro: An Internal Look for Programmers

libRetro is a versatile framework designed to facilitate the development of emulators and games through a unified interface. 

This post explores the internal workings of libRetro, providing insights tailored for programmers interested in understanding how libRetro cores and frontends operate.

## What is libRetro?

libRetro is an API that enables developers to create emulators (referred to as "cores") for various retro gaming platforms. 

It abstracts the complexity of different systems, allowing cores to be easily integrated into different frontends. 

The framework supports a wide array of platforms (e.g Win, Mac, Linux and even games consoles), making it a popular choice for both developers and users.

## Architecture Overview

libRetro consists of two main components: the core and the frontend. 

The core is the actual emulator, while the frontend provides the user interface and additional features.

### Cores

Each core implements the libRetro API, which includes functions for:

- Initialization
- Frame rendering
- Input handling
- Audio processing
- Save state management

The cores are responsible for emulating the hardware of a specific system. 
They take care of processing the game code, rendering graphics, and managing audio, effectively mimicking the original hardware's behavior. 

They are based on standalone emulators modified to conform to the libRetro API specification.

### Frontends

Frontends are the user-facing applications that utilize the cores. 

They provide a graphical interface for users to load games, configure settings, and interact with the emulator. 

Frontends can vary widely in features and design, but they all communicate with the cores through the libRetro API.

The most popular frontend is **RetroArch**.

## Key Functions in libRetro

The libRetro API is composed of several key functions that facilitate communication between the frontend and the core:

### retro_init

This function initializes the core and prepares it for execution. It sets up the necessary resources and state required for the emulator to run.

### retro_run

The retro_run function is called in a loop during the emulation process. It processes a single frame of the game, handling input, updating the state, and rendering graphics. 
This function is crucial for maintaining the flow of the game.

### retro_set_input_poll and retro_set_input_state

These functions handle input from the user. retro_set_input_poll is called to poll the input devices, while retro_set_input_state allows the core to access the current state of the input devices.

### retro_deinit

Once the emulation session is over, the retro_deinit function cleans up resources allocated by the core. 
This function ensures that the emulator can terminate gracefully.

## How Cores Communicate with Frontends

Communication between the core and frontend is achieved through a series of function calls defined in the libRetro API. 
When a user interacts with the frontend, it translates those actions into function calls that the core understands. 
This architecture allows for a seamless experience, where the frontend can manage user interactions while the core focuses on emulation.
