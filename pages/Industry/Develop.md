# Develop
**Develop** was a UK magazine dedicated to game developers in the industry similar to the US magazine **Game Developer**, it published 11 issues a year, one a month except December and January where there was one issue for both months. After 188 issues it was merged with its sister title **MCV** to become **MCV/Develop** but it kept the MCV issue numbering.

For most of its run the magazine was divided into the following 3 sections:
* **Alpha** - News and views on game development
* **Beta** - Development features, Interviews, essays and more
* **Build** - The latest tools news, tech updates and tutorials

Other subsections included:
* **Develop Jobs** - Your monthly guide to the best career opportunities in games development worldwide
* **Directory** - The world’s premier listing of games development studios, tools, outsourcing specialists, services and courses

## Game Dev Family Tree
One of the sections I love about the magazine was the interesting "Family Tree" diagrams that focussed on one city every month, here is an example of Liverpool:
![Liverpool Game Dev Family Tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3539dfa9-5480-4774-8a69-192a14834609)

it was either sponsored by Amiqus or just an entire Advert by them, but either way it provided very interesting information as the games industry is full of mergers, aquisitions and new studios being formed by former employees of other studios.

## The Develop Industry Excellence Awards
Develop hosted an annual game development awards ceremony which was highly coveted in the industry, especially in europe but was also known worldwide. From 2003 until the present day the awards were judged by a panel of 50+ industry professionals across a laerge number of categories (18 in 2005) [^1].

It is held in London every year and the first was at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington on August 27th 2003 [^2].
