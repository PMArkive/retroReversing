Other subsections included:

## Game Dev Family Tree
One of the sections I love about the magazine was the interesting "Family Tree" diagrams that focussed on one city every month, here is an example of Liverpool:
![Liverpool Game Dev Family Tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3539dfa9-5480-4774-8a69-192a14834609)

it was either sponsored by Amiqus or just an entire Advert by them, but either way it provided very interesting information as the games industry is full of mergers, aquisitions and new studios being formed by former employees of other studios.

## The Develop Industry Excellence Awards
Develop hosted an annual game development awards ceremony which was highly coveted in the industry, especially in europe but was also known worldwide. From 2003 until the present day the awards were judged by a panel of 50+ industry professionals across a laerge number of categories (18 in 2005) [^1].

It is held in London every year and the first was at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington on August 27th 2003 [^2].

## The Website
From 2001 Develop had a website at the url **http://www.developmag.com** which later changed to **http://www.develop-online.net/** in July 2009.

It was initially (2001-2004) a very basic website with a very brief description of the main articles, circulation information and a **media pack** containing circulation information to attract advertisers.

In July 2005 they redesigned their website to include much more information including news which mostly linked to gamasutra articles before switching briefly to Next generation and theneventually posting news articles of their own. A PDF download of the latest issue was available but only after filling in a form to get it emailed to you.

## Cover Art
The Develop magazine had some great cover art throughout the years, we will list a couple of our favourites below. We don't have all the issues so apologies if your favourite is missing.

Issue 37 advertises "Vivarin" a game development supplement to help with Game Crunches (for PS2, Xbox or Gamecube developers):
