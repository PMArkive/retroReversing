The practice of game cloning in arcades and consoles goes back to the industry’s origins – to take a quote from a 2001 issue of the Japanese **CONTINUE** magazine [^1]:
> “the entire game industry itself began with copyright infringement, ever since Space Invaders..”

This timeline charts key instances of companies reverse-engineering or copying each other’s video games from the 1980s through the 2000s, focusing on arcade and home console titles. Each entry highlights notable clones, imitation games, and legal/technological battles that shaped industry norms.

# Late 1970s–Early 1980s: The Dawn of Arcade Clones

## 1978–1979: Taito’s hit Space Invaders (1978) sparks a wave of imitators

Even **Nintendo** entered the fray, releasing **Space Fever** in 1979 – a clear Space Invaders clone – to capitalize on the alien-shooting craze [^2]. 
Such copying was common in the young arcade industry, with many companies producing their own versions of successful games.

## 1980–1981: Pac-Man Clones

Pac-Man (Namco, 1980) becomes a global phenomenon, and an explosion of unauthorized clones follows.

Small manufacturers hacked or re-skinned Pac-Man into games like Mighty Mouth and Piranha, which were nearly identical in maze layout and character design. 
By 1981, dozens of Pac-Man knock-offs appeared across arcades and home systems.

This prompted Pac-Man’s U.S. distributor, Midway, and rights-holder Atari to aggressively defend the IP in court. 
In one case, a judge described Mighty Mouth as “for all practical purposes, identical” to Pac-Man [^3], leading Midway to win a 1983 summary judgment for copyright and trademark infringement.

## 1981–1982: K.C. Munchkin (Philips) sued by Atari

K.C. Munchkin! for the Odyssey² console (Philips) became a landmark in clone litigation.
The maze-chase game was so similar to Pac-Man that Atari (which had console rights to Pac-Man) sued. 
In 1982, the U.S. Seventh Circuit court ruled that K.C. Munchkin! infringed Pac-Man’s copyrighted characters and maze design, ordering the clone off the market [^4]. 

This case – Atari, Inc. v. Philips – was among the first to affirm that a video game’s audiovisual “look and feel” could be protected by copyright law.
