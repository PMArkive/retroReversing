# Explore the Tools of the Trade

Back in the day, game development was both an art and a science, involving a unique set of tools and technologies. On this site, you'll find comprehensive links and guides to the essential tools used during the golden era of video game creation. Here's a glimpse of what you can expect:

## Programming

### **Programming Languages**
Discover the programming languages that powered the classics. From the assembly languages that squeezed every ounce of performance from early hardware to the C and C++ languages that enabled more complex game designs, we cover the essentials that brought pixels to life. Dive into the specifics of languages such as:

- **Assembly**: The low-level language used for its unparalleled control over hardware.
- **C**: The versatile language that struck a balance between performance and portability.
- **C++**: The language that introduced object-oriented programming to game development.

### **Assemblers & Compilers**
Learn about the assemblers and compilers that transformed code into playable games. These powerful tools were pivotal in optimizing and translating the developers' visions into the games we remember. Understand the role of early compilers and their impact on game performance and development workflows. Key tools include:

- **Assemblers**: Programs like MASM and TASM that converted assembly code into machine code.
- **Compilers**: Tools like GCC and Watcom C that compiled higher-level code into efficient machine code.

## Asset Development

### **3D Modelling**
Explore the evolution of 3D modeling tools that gave depth and realism to early 3D games. From primitive polygon editors to the pioneering software that laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated 3D graphics, get insights into the creative processes behind iconic game visuals. Essential tools and techniques include:

- **Early Polygon Editors**: Basic tools for creating simple 3D models.
- **Advanced Modelling Software**: Programs like 3D Studio, SoftImage and Maya that allowed for more detailed and complex designs.
- **Texture Mapping**: Techniques for applying textures to 3D models to enhance visual realism.

### **Music Creation**
Music has always been a cornerstone of the gaming experience. Uncover the music creation tools and techniques that produced the memorable soundtracks of retro games. Learn about the hardware limitations and ingenious methods composers used to create captivating game music. Important aspects include:

- **Sound Chips**: Hardware like the SID chip in the Commodore 64 and the Yamaha YM2612 in the Sega Genesis that defined the sound of many classic games.
- **Tracker Software**: Programs like FastTracker and ProTracker that allowed composers to create music with limited hardware capabilities.
- **MIDI Composition**: The use of MIDI to sequence and control sound modules and synthesizers for richer game audio.
