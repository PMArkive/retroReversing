One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the books that were available to developers at the time, both game-specific books, programming books and digital/creative books have a wealth of information.

As this is a site about retro games, we are mainly aiming to add books that were published around the time of retro consoles **or** books about retro game development.

This page is split into the following categories:
* Books published around the same time as retro games
* Books about Retro Game Development with Modern Tools

# Books published around the same time as retro games

This section will cover books available at the time when retro games were being created, for added context this section is broken down by year. 

The list of books in this section is not an exhaustive list and mainly includes books that would have been notable at the time. We only list the book based on its first edition date in order to keep the lists a bit cleaner.

## Notable Publishers
Some of the most note-worthy publishers for game development related books on this list are:
* **A. K. Peters Ltd** - Textbooks related to Computer Graphics and ran from 1992 to 2010 before being bought by **CRC Press**
* **CRC Press** - Started Game development books in 2003 and still running until present day
* **Charles River Media** - Game Development series ran from 2002 to 2009
* **Jones and Bartlett Publishers**
* **Morgan Kaufmann** - The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Graphics ran from 1989-2018
* **New Riders Games (NRG)** - From 2003 to 2014
* **Premier Press** - From 2001 until they became **Thomson Course Technology PTR** in October 2003 [^6]
* **Prima Tech**[^2] - Becomes Premier Press in 2001 [^4]
* **Sams** - Famous for the Sams teach yourself series but not many game specific books (1988-Present)
* **Thomson Course Technology PTR** - Becomes Cengage Learning in July 2007
* **Waite Group Press** - Published the Black art of game programming series of books and early books on 3D graphics [^1]
* **Wordware Game Developer's Library** - From 1999 to 2009 (Becomes Jones and Bartlett Publishers)

## Notable Authors
Some of the most prolific authors in the game development genre are:
* **Andre LaMothe** - Celebrated author and editor for the entire Prima Tech/Premier Press Game Development Book Series.
* **Jonathan S. Harbour** - Authored over 20 programming books. Worked on the Sega Mega Drive version of "Wayne Gretzky Hockey" using a scripting language and Motorola 68K Assembly Language.
* **Mark DeLoura** - Author of the first two Game Programming Gems books (along with the Best of version) and editor of Game Developer magazine.
* **Steve Rabin** - Specializes in Game AI books such as the Game AI Wisdom series.
* **Wolfgang Engel** - Specializes in game graphics, specifically shader development, writing books such as the ShaderX series.

## Notable Series
We have a separate post on the excellent "Game Programming Starter Kit" series. It was a very successful way to provide professional PC development software along with industry-standard books to amateur developers. It even included Visual Studio and, later on, some other software such as Dark Basic.

## Published in 1976
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 1976, the year when the home game console market was just starting to take off with the release of the **Channel F**. It was also the year that Zilog would launch their Z80 microchip which would be used in many consoles and home computers in the future. 

Cover | Title | Author | Software | Notes

<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="/public/images/books/Z80-CPU Technical Manual [1976].jpg" /> | Zilog Z80-CPU Technical Manual | Zilog | Z80 Assembly | 

### Fairchild Channel F
<section class="postSection">
    <img data-image-full="/public/images/books/F8 Guide To Programming [1977].jpg" class="lazy-load wow slideInLeft postImage" style="width:250px" />

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
This was the year the **Fairchild Channel F** was released, the first ever games console with interchangeable cartridges (ROMs) and the first to be based on a microprocessor (Fairchild F8).

Fairchild released a development kit which came with a book titled **F8 Guide to Programming**, if you were a developer at the time who wanted to write games for the Channel F then this would be the go-to book!

### Zilog Z80
<section class="postSection">
    <img data-image-full="/public/images/books/Z80-CPU Technical Manual [1976].jpg" class="lazy-load wow slideInLeft postImage" style="width:250px" />

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
We start with the **Z80-CPU Technical Manual** from Zilog as it was used in so many early games consoles and home computers, it was very likely that you would have an iteration of this book if you were a developer for any of the following:
* Game Boy
* Master System/Game Gear
* AmstradCPC
* MSX
* ZX Spectrum.

Of course by the time those consoles came out there were newer editions of the book and a few people had written their own Z80 textbooks but it remains a very important book int he history of game development.

## Published in 1978
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 1978.

The **Apple II** and **Atari 2600 VCS** had just been released in the previous year (September 1977) which was using a variant of the popular 6502 CPU (6507) and books were starting to spring up on the topic of programming for this family of chips.

Cover | Title | Author | Software | Notes
---|---|---|---|---
<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51T+cX9MqNL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" /> | Programming the 6502 | Zaks, Rodnay | 
<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NH37S7YRL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg" /> | The C programming language | Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie | C Programming | 
<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GWas-gWPL._SX357_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" /> | The Z-80 Microcomputer Handbook | William J. Barden | 

The book **Programming the 6502** was perfect for any new programmers who wanted to tap into the full potential of their Apple II or Atari 2600 as it introduced basic programming concepts and binary formats (e.g Two's compliment) in a very easy to understand way. It also contained a full reference for all of the assembly instructions and even diagrams explaining how they worked. If you are looking for a book to learn 6502 assembly in the same way most early game developers did then this is the book to choose.

## Published in 1979
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 1979. This was the year that the **Intellivision** was released from **Mattel** which used the **CP-1600** CPU from **General Instrument**.

The Intellivision was the only production use for the **CP-1600** CPU and thus as far as we can tell no books were released on developing for the Intellivision or its CPU. Although there were a few strategy books about playing Intellivision games and a few modern books have been released about Intellivision game development.

<img class="lazy-load" data-image-full="https://www.retroreversing.com/public/images/books/Electronic games - design, programming and troubleshooting.jpg" /> | Electronic games: design, programming and troubleshooting | WALTER H. BUCHSBAUM | 8080 Assembly | 

The book titled **Electronic games: design, programming and troubleshooting** is an absolute gem, it explains how all the components of a typical 1970s game console/arcade machine works, including how to interface with standard Color and B/W Televisions and an extensive section on microprocessors. It is a very low level book focusing on the elexctronics hardware and would still be worth reading today, sure some parts are out of date but the concepts are the same.

It contains a section on programming and even although this book was published in 1979 the representation of an assembly program will still be very familiar to fellow reverse engineers:

## Published in 1981
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 1981. This was the year that the **SINCLAIR ZX81** was released which used the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. 
It was the go to choice for bedroom programmers as it was very cheap and games could be written to cassette tapes and distributed. Towards the end of the year the **BBC MICRO** was released in the UK and became hugely successful and was one of the first computers for many future programmers in the UK Games Industry.

## Published in 1983
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 1983, the year that the **Vectrex** was released worldwide based on the **Motorola 6809** cpu. 

It was also a big year for Japan with the release of the **MSX** which for many was their first experience having a programmable home computer. With a Zilog Z80 cpu and a variant of BASIC (MSX BASIC) it was ideal for bedroom game development in Japan.

As for consoles it was also the year that Nintendo released their **Famicom** based on a 6502 CPU, but Nintendo has strict licensing agreements which limited third-party development. Despite this famous developers such as **Satoshi Tajiri** of Pokemon fame cobbled together his own Famicom development kit from old circuit boards obtained in Akihabara junk shops [^7].

## Published in 1995
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 1995, which is the year the Virtual Boy was released in Japan and the Saturn and Playstation were released in the US & Europe.

On the Windows front, for graphics programming the API **WinG** was released by Microsoft in 1994 so in 1995 we started to see our first books about programming games in this API. 
Although the API was short lived as it was replaced by the **Windows Games SDK** in 1995 and later renamed to **DirectX**.

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
Imagine being a book author during this time frame when **WinG** was only really applicable for about a year, replaced with the Windows Game SDK which was then renamed to DirectX. 
   
   This happened to the author **Clayton Walnum** who released **Dungeons of Discovery: Writing Dazzling Windows Games With WinG** in 1995 only for it to be deprecated. 
   
   He then released **Windows 95 Game Sdk Strategy Guide** just as it got renamed to DirectX, how unfortunate!

### Black Art of 3D Game Programming
"Black Art of 3D Game Programming," authored by André LaMothe, is a seminal book in the field of game development, first published in 1995. It provides a comprehensive guide to the principles and techniques of 3D game programming, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

The book is notable for its thorough exploration of the mathematical foundations required for 3D graphics, including vector and matrix operations, transformations, and perspective projections. It delves into the intricacies of 3D engines, discussing topics such as rendering pipelines, shading models, and texture mapping.

## Published in 1996
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 1996, which is the year the Nintendo 64 was released.

There were some excellent books released by **Waite Group Press** [^1] such as the **Black Art of Macintosh Game Programming** and the **OpenGL SuperBible** which were both cutting-edge at the time.

Also the author **Joe Gradecki** released two books this year in the **NetWarriors** series, one an update to his book last year but this time in C++ and the other a guide to online resources, which would be very interesting to read nowadays, although most links would now be long dead.

### 3D Games: Real-time Rendering and Software Technology
<section class="postSection">
    <img data-image-full="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XAPYD6VQL._AC_UY436_QL65_.jpg" class="lazy-load wow slideInLeft postImage" />

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
There were a few books on 3D game programming released in 2000, one of the best has to be **3D Games: Real-time Rendering and Software Technology**.
   
Although not an easy read and fairly Maths heavy, it is very in-depth and shows some very advanced concepts, even shows SIMD assembly programming in the first chapter.
   
   The book is split up into 6 sections each with their own chapters:
* **Modeling and foundation maths** - This section deals with the basic mathematics required to handle objects in three-dimensional space and the theory of object representation.
* **Classical 3D graphics** - Although much of the material in this section has migrated onto hardware, it is still necessary to have an appreciation of what
the hardware does to be able to use it effectively.
* **Real-time rendering** - This section deals with the technology developed by the games industry and the virtual reality industry which enables complex scenes to be rendered, to a reasonably high quality, in real time on a low-cost graphics processor.
* **Control of objects** - Mainstream techniques used to control the movement of objects are described in this section. This ranges from simple low-level control through to behavioural animation using Al technology. The material on Al is in the form of a debate concerning the potential use of the technology in the future.
* **2D technology** - A potentially important solution to the complexity problem in 3D graphics, in terms of both the creation cost and the rendering cost, is the use of image-based rendering techniques.
* **Software technology** - This section deals with the techniques needed to write a multi-player game using the currently popular first-person shooter genre as an example. We examine the software architecture of a games engine and look at the design of the engine. Finally a comprehensive reference manual for the engine is given.

Although part of the book is taken up by the Fly3D SDK reference which was also on the CD (pages 617-749), this might have been useful as a physical reference in the past but not useful nowadays. 

The Appendices have some tutorials for how to use the FlySDK including building levels with 3D Studio Max and exporting to the BSP format used by the engine. These appendices end with you having a controllable 3D model space ship driving around a map, they are the easiest to understand and the most enjoyable section of the book.

## Published in 2001
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 2001.

This year **Prima Tech** released tons of very specialised game development books all aimed at Indie game developers. They were so successful that in August 2001 [^4] they got sold and changed their name to **Premier Press** and thankfully continued to churn out book after book on game development!

This year started to see books covering **DirectX 8.0**.

## Published in 2003
This section will cover books related to game development published in the year 2003.

In the year 2003 started to see a lot more game development books focussed on non-programming related topics such as production and Business.

The year 2003 was the start of **New Riders Games (NRG)** a subset of New Riders Publishing purely focussed on Game Development topics. While **New Riders Pub** had dabbled with a game development book in the form of **Get in the Game!** from 2002 along with previous books on software such as Photoshop and 3D Studio, this year they jumped all in with a series that would last more than a decade until 2014!

# Books about Retro Game Development with Modern Tools
We tend to only cover retro games on this site and although the term retro means different things to different people, we have decided not to list game development books from 2010 and beyond. However we would like to list books published after 2010 if they are about Retro Game Development, that is what this section is for.

Most of these books employ modern tools to create games for retro hardware such as the ZX Spectrum or Commodore 64 through emulators which is a lot more accessible than using hardware and software from the time period.

This section will cover:
* Retro Game Dev - Commodore 64
* The Making of Karateka - 2012
* You: A Novel - 2012 (Fiction)
* Programming the Nintendo Game Boy Advance - 2012
* Behind the Scenes at Sega: The Making of a Video Game - 2015
* ZX Spectrum Games Code Club: Twenty fun games to code and learn - 2015
* * Making Games for the Atari 2600 - 2016
* I Am Error: The Nintendo Family Computer / Entertainment System Platform - 2017
* Programming Games for Intellivision - 2018
* Code the Classics - 2019
* Candid Conversations in Code
* The Making of Prince of Persia - 2020
* Modern MSX BASIC Game Development: Build retro games in MSX BASIC using modern tools - 2021
* Bare-Metal Amiga Programming: For OCS, ECS and AGA - 2021
* Advanced Game Programming for Intellivision - 2021
* Game Boy Coding Adventure: A complete, practical, timeless programming guide - 2022

## Candid Conversations in Code (2020)

* **Gregory Cox** - Programmer for Cyan Engineering March 4 1974 to August 16 1974
* **David Shepperd** - Programmer for Atari, Inc. and Atari Games 1976-2003
* **Rich Moore** - Programmer and Manager for Atari, Inc. and Atari Games 1978-1993
* **Tom McHugh** - Programmer for Dave Nutting Associates 1975-1982 and Action Graphics 1982-1985
* **Jamie Fenton** - Programmer for Dave Nutting Associates 1975-1982
* **Mark Lesser** - Programmer for Rockwell 1976-1978, Mattel 1978-1982, Parker Brothers 1982-1984, Microsmiths 1987-1992, Electronic Arts 1992-2000
